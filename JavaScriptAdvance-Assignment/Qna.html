        <h2>Q.1 What is JavaScript. How to use it?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that
            moves,
            refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features
            like:
            animated graphics. photo slideshows. <br><br>
            We can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML tag
            script that wraps around JavaScript code.The script tag can be placed in the head section of our HTML or in
            the body section, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Q.2 How many type of Variable in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>here are three types of variables: var, let, and const. The var keyword, the original method of variable
            declaration,
            has function scope and can be hoisted. let and const were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address
            scoping issues</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Q.3 Define a Data Types in js?</h2>
        <p>data types represent the kind of values that can be manipulated and stored in variables. The language has two
            main
            categories of data types: primitive and non primitive.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Q.5 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, "undefined" refers to the absence of a value or the result of accessing an uninitialized
            variable or
            non-existent object property. A declared variable that has not been assigned a value automatically holds the
            value
            "undefined". On the other hand, an "undeclared" variable is one that has not been formally declared using
            keywords like
            var, let, or const, and attempting to access it results in a ReferenceError.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Q.6 What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, a loop is a programming construct that allows a set of instructions to be repeatedly executed
            as long as
            a specified condition is true. The three primary types of loops are the for loop, which provides precise
            control over
            initialization, condition, and iteration; the while loop, which repeats a block of code while a condition is
            true; and
            the do-while loop, similar to while but ensures at least one execution of the code block. <br><br>
            The switch statement evaluates an expression, and based on its value, control is transferred to the
            corresponding case
            block. Each case block can include one or more statements, and the break statement is used to exit the
            switch statement
            once a match is found. If no match is found, an optional default block can be executed.</p>

        <h2>Q.7 What is the use of is Nan function?</h2>
        <p>The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not a Number). It returns true
            if the
            provided value is NaN and false if it is a valid number or can be converted to a valid number.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Q.8 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, && and || are logical operators used for combining and evaluating conditions. <br><br>
            The && operator returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns false. It short-circuits the
            evaluation,
            meaning that if the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated, as the overall result will
            always be
            false. <br><br>
            The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true; otherwise, it returns false. Like &&,
            it also
            short-circuits the evaluation, so if the first operand is true, the second operand is not evaluated, as the
            overall
            result will always be true.</p>
