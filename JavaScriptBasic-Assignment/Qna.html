        <h1>JavaScript Basic Assignment</h1>
        <h2>1. What is JavaScript. How to use it?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development.
            It allows us to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to
            websites. <br>
            we can include JavaScript code directly within HTML using the
            script tag and we can also link to external JavaScript files using the src attribute of the
            script tag.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
        <p>The Number.isNaN() static method determines whether the passed value is the number value NaN, and returns
            false if the
            input is not of the Number type. It is a more robust version of the original, global isNaN() function.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
        <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical
            function
            generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed
            JavaScript as a
            scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
        <p>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not
            a keyword.
            Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h2>
        <p>
            New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method. <br>
        <pre>let newDiv = document.createElement("div");</pre>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>
        <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making
            state
            management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage
            content from
            this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>8. What is === operator?</h2>
        <p>The strict equality operator === , also known as triple equals, compares both the value and the type of its
            operands.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
        <p>To change the style of an element directly, you can access its style property. The style property is an
            object that
            represents the inline style of an element. You can modify its properties to change the appearance of the
            element.</p>
        <pre>let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
            element.style.backgroundColor = "red";</pre>
        <hr>
        <h2>10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>In web development, JavaScript provides different ways to read and write files. However, keep in mind that
            client-side JavaScript (running in a browser) has limitations due to security restrictions. For more
            advanced file operations, you might need to use server-side JavaScript (Node.js) or work with a server API.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript provides several looping structures for repetitive execution of code. The traditional for loop
            allows for
            precise control over initialization, condition, and iteration. The while loop repeats a block of code while
            a specified
            condition is true, and the do-while loop ensures at least one execution of the code block.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, we can convert a string representing a number in any base to an integer using the parseInt
            function. The
            parseInt function takes two arguments: the string to be converted, and the base of the numeral system.
        <pre>var binaryString = "101010";
var decimalNumber = parseInt(binaryString, 2);
console.log(decimalNumber); // Output: 42</pre>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, the delete operator is used to delete a property from an object. Its primary purpose is to
            remove a
            property along with its value from an object.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, there are three main types of pop-up boxes that are commonly used for user interaction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert Box (alert())</li>
            <li>Confirm Box (confirm())</li>
            <li>Prompt Box (prompt())</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h2>15. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>To force a page to load another page in JavaScript, you can use the window.location object to change the
            current URL.
            There are different ways to achieve this, depending on our requirements. Here are a couple of common
            methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>window.location.href</li>
            <li>window.location.replace()</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>16. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>While innerHTML is a convenient and widely used property in JavaScript for manipulating the content of HTML
            elements, it
            comes with some potential disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security Risks (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)</li>
            <li>Performance Impact</li>
            <li>Overwrites Event Listeners and Data</li>
            <li>Limited Error Handling</li>
        </ul>
