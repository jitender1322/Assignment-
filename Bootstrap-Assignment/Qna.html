        <h2>Q. What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h2>
        <h3>Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, offers several advantages that streamline web development.
            First
            and foremost,
            it provides a responsive grid system and a plethora of pre-designed components, such as navigation bars,
            forms, and
            modals, enabling developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across various devices.
            Bootstrap's
            extensive documentation simplifies implementation, and its robust community support ensures access to a wide
            range of
            resources and third-party plugins.</h3>

        <h2>Q. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
        <h3>A Bootstrap container is a foundational element in the Bootstrap framework used to structure and contain the
            content of
            a webpage. It provides a responsive, fixed-width layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a
            consistent and
            visually appealing design. The container works in conjunction with Bootstrap's grid system, allowing
            developers to
            organize content into rows and columns within the container, making it easy to create responsive and
            well-organized
            layouts for various devices. By using either the standard container or the fluid container, developers can
            quickly
            implement a structured and responsive design, enhancing the overall user experience.</h3>

        <h2>Q. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h2>
        <h3>The default text in Bootstrap has a base font size of 16 pixels, a line height of 1.5, and a font-family of
            "Helvetica
            Neue," Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. Additionally, Bootstrap includes responsive text classes, such as
            text-sm,
            text-md,
            and text-lg, to adjust font sizes based on different screen sizes.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
        <h3>The Bootstrap Grid System is a responsive, mobile-first grid layout system that facilitates the creation of
            flexible and
            structured web page layouts. It is based on a 12-column grid, allowing developers to divide the page width
            into multiple
            columns and organize content in a systematic manner.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q. How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
        <h3>In Bootstrap, you can create thumbnails using the img-thumbnail class along with the grid system to
            structure the
            layout.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
        <h3>In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox (short for Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model that provides an efficient way
            to design
            and distribute space among items within a container, even if their size is unknown or dynamic. Bootstrap 4
            incorporates
            Flexbox extensively to create flexible and responsive layouts. The Flexbox model allows for the alignment,
            justification, and distribution of items along a single axis (row or column) or both axes simultaneously. It
            simplifies
            complex layout scenario</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q. How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?</h2>
        <h3>In Bootstrap, we can create alerts using the alert component. alerts are created using the alert class with
            different contextual colors (e.g., alert-primary, alert-success).</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q. What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</h2>
        <h3>To create a Bootstrap card, you typically use the <div> element with the class card. Within this container,
                you can
                include other Bootstrap components, such as headers, images, paragraphs, buttons, etc., to compose the
                content of
                the card. Additionally, you may customize the appearance of the card using various Bootstrap classes for
                styling,
                such as card-header, card-body, card-footer, card-title, card-text, and more.</h3>
